# S&P 500 Stock Market Prediction

## Overview

This project utilizes historical data from Yahoo Finance to predict S&P 500 stock market prices using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a robust predictive model that can forecast future stock market prices. The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the implementation of a predictive model, leveraging the Random Forest Classifier from scikit-learn.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install yfinance scikit-learn pandas
```

## Data Collection and Preprocessing
The historical stock market data is sourced from Yahoo Finance and undergoes preprocessing to ensure clean and reliable training data.

```bash
import yfinance as yf

sp500 = yf.Ticker("^GSPC")
sp500 = sp500.history(period="max")
# Additional data preprocessing steps may be necessary.
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Gain insights into data patterns and trends through exploratory data analysis and visualizations.

```bash
sp500.plot.line(y="Close", use_index=True)
# Additional EDA steps can be added.
```

## Model Training and Back-testing
Train the initial Random Forest model and implement a back-testing system to assess real-world performance.

```bash
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, min_samples_split=100, random_state=1)
# Additional model training and back-testing steps.
```

## Model Enhancement
Boost the model's confidence and accuracy by introducing additional predictors.

```bash
# Additional predictor creation and model enhancement steps
# ...
```
## Notes and Further Improvements
Explore and contribute to the project by comparing results with other stock tickers, experimenting with different machine learning models, and incorporating more predictors.
